# Cryptoadz-Traits-Web-App

### Description ###

A web app that allows a user to choose a specific Cryptoadz trait and see the other users who own a Cryptoadz with this trait.

### Benefits ### 

1) Owners of a specific Cryptoadz trait can communicate with all other users who own a Cryptoadz with that trait -> Formation of communities within communities
 
    ```
    E.g. Red Nounish Glasses community, Green Party Hat community, etc..
    ```
2) Users looking to invest in a Cryptoadz will have a better idea of which traits are rare and owned by whales. Whales can be defined as users who hold a large amount of ETH, or other valuable assets (punks, art blocks grail, etc..)

### Development ###

- Integration of OpenSea API and EtherScan API
  
  ```
  OpenSea API -> get Cryptoadz traits and users who own these traits

  EtherScan API -> get information on those users
  ```

(*TBC*)
